# Embracing Change: <br> My Thoughts on AI as a Developer

ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!

Today we're diving into a topic that's been buzzing in the tech community â€“ the impact of AI on coding careers. It's a controversial subject, but one that keeps popping up on all my feeds, so let's address it head-on. Should you become a developer in the age of AI, or are we headed for a weird future where robots take over? Let's break it down.

## The Evolution of Technology

First, let's acknowledge that technology is always evolving. From the Industrial Revolution to the internet, certain jobs become obsolete, but new opportunities emerge. AI is simply the next step in our technological journey. While it's true that some entry-level coding tasks may be automated, it doesn't just make learning to code irrelevant; in fact, I think it could become more crucial than ever.

## Adapting to Change

Sure, AI will take over some repetitive tasks, but as developers, we can harness its power to work better and faster. I've experienced it firsthand with tools like co-pilot & ChatGPT making my coding process way, way more efficient. Rather than fixating on hypothetical scenarios a decade into the future, the crucial approach is to embrace the current changes and employ AI as a tool to improve our skills.

## How Jobs are Changing

Yes, there might be some job loss due to automation, but it's essential to focus on the changing job landscape. As a developer, you have the opportunity to move beyond mundane tasks and concentrate on the bigger picture. AI can pave the way for more creativity and innovation, allowing us to tackle bigger and better challenges.

## Humans

One aspect where humans excel and AI can't replicate is our humanity. Creativity, passion, personality â€“ these are traits that machines can't possess. While AI can generate code and solve problems, it lacks a unique human vision. Personal relationships still matter, and being human brings a touch to tech that AI cannot ever replace. Seriously.

## Adapting

In the face of technological advancements, there might be a need to learn more to land a job, but that's not unique to the tech industry. Adaptability is a trait that any successful professional must cultivate. Instead of fearing job loss, focus on evolving with the changes, honing your skills, and thriving alongside AI.

## Embracing the Future:

Change is inevitable, and it's on us to decide how we want to navigate it. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting, learning to code in the age of AI is not just a matter of survival â€“ it's a chance to thrive. Embrace the evolving tech landscape, continue learning, and leverage AI as a tool to boost your capabilities.

## Some Final Thoughts...

So, should you bother learning to code in the age of AI? 100% Yes. It's not about succumbing to doom and gloom; it's about embracing change and using it to your advantage. If you truly have a passion for coding, focus on being the best developer you can be, adapt to the evolving tech scene, and success will follow. I promise.

Thanks for tuning in, and until next time, happy coding!
